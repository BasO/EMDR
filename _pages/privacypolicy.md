# Privacy Policy
The developer of the EMDR app does not collect user data, and does not track users in any way. At the time of purchase, the app does notify the developer that a purchase has been made. Some system information such as your device type is included in the process. No data is ever shared with third parties.

If you'd like to send the developer a mail or other form of communication, you choose what kinds of personal data you include. Communication is regarded as private and therefore no part of it is shared with third parties. Deliberate measures are in place to prevent communication hacks or leaks. Communication is stored until it loses its relevance to the development of the app or to the contacter, whichever comes last. You can request to have some or all of your personal data deleted sooner, via emdrapp [at] icloud [dot] com, or via Twitter's @EMDRapp, in which case we'll do so as soon as possible but always within two months.
